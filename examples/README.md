React Sampler Example App
=========================

To run this example just clone the repository and then:

```
  npm install
  npm install http-server -g
  npm run run-example
```
And open a browser in [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

Due to the simple `http-server` used for the demo not supporting partial content, the starting position of the samples is ignored and they always start at second 0. This should not happen if you use a web server like Apache, etc.
